# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

## Useful commands

```shell
npx hardhat --network mumbai run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat --network mumbai run scripts/mint.js
npx hardhat verify --network mumbai --constructor-args arguments.js 0x763d074600D9d2747bc8C6D31568342c41D978eD
